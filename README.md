Sample Project Title: "MamaMilk: Breastmilk Transportation Solution for Working Mothers"

Problem Statement: Many working mothers, especially those who are breastfeeding, face challenges in safely transporting breastmilk from home to their workplace or daycare centers. Traditional methods of carrying breastmilk, such as using cooler bags or bottles, may not always provide optimal insulation or convenience, leading to concerns about milk spoilage or contamination during transit.

Project Description: The MamaMilk project aims to develop a specialized solution for working mothers to safely transport breastmilk from home to their workplace or daycare centers. The solution will incorporate innovative design features and materials to ensure proper insulation, hygiene, and convenience for breastfeeding mothers on the go.
